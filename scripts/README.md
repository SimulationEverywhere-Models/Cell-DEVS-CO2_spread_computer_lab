The following programs are written in Python 3. Some of the following code requires 3rd party modules to run which are specified in each program's respective documentation (PDF).
The "create-model", "model-visualizer", and "co2-charting" programs were tested almost exclusively on Windows 10 using either Command Prompt or Powershell.
While other operating systems with valid installations of Python 3 and the required modules should work, only Windows 10 has been tested.
